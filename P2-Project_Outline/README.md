## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here
Private ambulance companies make most of their money from doing basic transfers. A transfer is non-emergency call when a hospital needs to discharge a patient and the patient is unable to sit in a wheelchair or has some medical needs that need to be met while enroute. When a hospital arranges a transfer with an ambulance company, a nurse or a social worker has to call the company and give them a list of information about the patient while the operator enters the information into a form. The nurse could be put on hold if the company is busy and the operator could be puttng someone else on hold that really needs help. 
I am making a website that a nurse could use to enter patient information herself into a form and send it to an ambulance company to arrange a transfer. This would prevent the nurse from being put on hold and the operator from answering another call. The operator will get a text when the form is submitted saying that they have another call, and the nurse will get a text when the ambulance is enroute to the transfer pick up.
